<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Some time prior to the period at which this little history begins, my avocations had been largely increased. The good old office, now extinct in the State of New York, of a Master in Chancery, had been conferred upon me. It was not a very arduous office, but very pleasantly remunerative.

At one end, they looked upon the white wall of the interior of a spacious skylight shaft, penetrating the building from top to bottom.</p></div> </div>
