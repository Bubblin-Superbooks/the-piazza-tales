There he had touched for water.</p><p>On the second day, not long after dawn, while lying in his berth, his mate came below, informing him that a strange sail was coming into the bay. Ships were then not so plenty in those waters as now. He rose, dressed, and went on deck.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The morning was one peculiar to that coast.</p></div> </div>
