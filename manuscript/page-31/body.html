<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Pausing at the threshold, or rather where threshold once had been, I saw, through the open door-way, a lonely girl, sewing at a lonely window. A pale-cheeked girl, and fly-specked window, with wasps about the mended upper panes. I spoke. She shyly started, like some Tahiti girl, secreted for a sacrifice, first catching sight, through palms, of Captain Cook. Recovering, she bade me enter; with her apron brushed off a stool; then silently resumed her own. With thanks I took the stool; but now, for a space, I, too, was mute. This, then, is the fairy-mountain house, and here, the fairy queen sitting at her fairy window.</p><p>I went up to it. Downwards, directed by the tunneled pass, as through a leveled telescope,   I caught sight of a far-off, soft, azure world. I hardly knew it, though I came from it.</p><p>"You must find this view very pleasant," said I, at last.</p></div> </div>
