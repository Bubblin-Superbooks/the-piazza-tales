<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Silent I stood by the fairy window, while these things were being told.</p><p>"Do you know," said she at last, as stealing from her story, "do you know who lives yonder?—I have never been down into that country—away off there, I mean; that house, that marble one," pointing far across the lower landscape; "have you not caught it? there, on the long hill-side: the field before, the woods behind; the white shines out against their blue; don't you mark it? the only house in sight."</p><p>I looked; and after a time, to my surprise, recognized, more by its position than its aspect, or Marianna's description, my own abode, glimmering much like this mountain one from the piazza. The mirage haze made it appear less a farm-house than King Charming's palace.</p><p>"I have often wondered who lives there; but it must be some happy one; again this morning was I thinking so."</p></div> </div>
