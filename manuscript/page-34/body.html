<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>"Some happy one," returned I, starting; "and why do you think that? You judge some rich one lives there?"</p><p>"Rich or not, I never thought; but it looks so happy, I can't tell how; and it is so far   away. Sometimes I think I do but dream it is there. You should see it in a sunset."</p><p>"No doubt the sunset gilds it finely; but not more than the sunrise does this house, perhaps."</p><p>"This house? The sun is a good sun, but it never gilds this house. Why should it? This old house is rotting. That makes it so mossy. In the morning, the sun comes in at this old window, to be sure—boarded up, when first we came; a window I can't keep clean, do what I may—and half burns, and nearly blinds me at my sewing, besides setting the flies and wasps astir—such flies and wasps as only lone mountain houses know. See, here is the curtain—this apron—I try to shut it out with then. It fades it, you see. Sun gild this house? not that ever Marianna saw."</p></div> </div>
